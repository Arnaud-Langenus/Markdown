### Hobbies 
##### I have a few hobbies, but none that totally dominate my free time (usually). - I love:
* Music
* Cinema 
* Videogames. 
* Airsofting with friends
 
##### My preferred music styles are 
* EDM, so mostly 
    * Techno
    * Drum 'n Bass 
    * House 
* Others, like
    * Oldschool Rap
    * Soundtracks 
    * Disco <br/>
    
But usually I'll just listen to whatever song I like, regardless of genre or origin.

##### My favourite films include 
* _Pulp Fiction_ 
* _Blade Runner_ 
* _Apocalypse Now_ <br/>

but there are many more I like.



#### You can always count on me when 
 you have a jar of B&J Cookie Dough to trade for my services (or just simply when you ask, I always love to help). <br/>
 I am comfortable working alone, but have no issues, and actually prefer, working in group. I love taking on an issue in
 a team effort. I also highly value learning from my mistakes, so never be afraid to tell when I do something wrong.


#### A funny story 
When I was in Zimbabwe I went rafting on the Zambezi river. There is a rapid (a sudden increase in water velocity and turbulence) called [The Washing Machine](https://imgur.com/tcucOPJ),
where the raft capsized, and everyone on board got thrown into the coarsing river. <br/>
Everyone made it back on board apart from, of course, me. A life guard came to save me with his <br/>
hilariously short 1m long kayak, where I had to grab on like a baby monkey grabs on to the back <br/>
of his mother. This did not go to plan, because the next great rapid called The Terminator, a humongous torrent the size 
of the pool of tears I will cry once JavaScript starts, swallowed me whole, and dragged me down to the bottom of the river, where I stayed for exactly 11 seconds. The only proof I have <br/>
of this adventure is a picture of me on the moment of capsizing, and when my lifeguard <br/>
decided I wasn't wet enough already ([Proof](https://imgur.com/a/pJKgGuq)).
<br/>

##### TL;DR 
I learned that wildwater rafting is not fun if you can't breathe underwater.
